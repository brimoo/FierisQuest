Final Project for CSE165: Object Oriented Programming. Fieri's Quest is a path finding algorithm visualizer written in C++/OpenGL that supports A* (manhattan heuristic), Dijkstra's, BFS, and DFS. 

## Dependencies
Requires freeglut and glu to be installed and in your system's path.

## Compiling
### Linux
Run `make` in the project directory to build the fieris_quest executable. Remember to
run `make clean` to clean the directory when done.

### Windows
Could be compiled from the command line, but using Visual Studio is recommended.

### MacOS
Can be compiled using `make` just like in Linux, or you can use an IDE like XCode.
